  I'm Seungjo Han, a **Generalist Junior Product Manager. #Dynamic #Self-Starter #Team Player**<br/>
  I led several projects and took the role as <mark>PM</mark> in Software, Business, Leadership, and Design.<br/>
  I do believe the **positive power** from the growth through **overcoming limits** and **making an impact together with people.** 
  So I'm always trying to experience **different kinds of fields** and aggressively **communicate** as much as I can.<br/> 
  I feel responsible for delivering **positive impact** and enjoy meeting customers and making changes through **developing ideas** no matter the size.

# I try constantly to challenge myself.<br/>
# Experiences in business, software engineering, communication, and leadership have enabled me to become the professional I am today.<br/>
# My main goal is to leave my mark in line with my personal ideas, drawing on my past experiences to promote the ongoing expansion of innovation in the company.
